# **Characterizing the fractal dimension of the Orion Molecular Cloud**
Repository of the code for the Master Thesis "Characterizing the fractal dimension of the Orion Molecular Cloud". 
- Read [Fractal_Dimension_PA.ipynb](https://github.com/SimoneSped/fractal_OMC/blob/main/Fractal_Dimension_PA.ipynb) for the analysis with the PA-Relation to Orion A and B.
- Read [Validity_PA_BC.ipynb](https://github.com/SimoneSped/fractal_OMC/blob/main/Validity_PA_BC.ipynb) for the comparison with other methods (Box Counting) and overall properties of the PA relation.
- Read [Simulation_PA.ipynb](https://github.com/SimoneSped/fractal_OMC/blob/main/Simulations_PA.ipynb) for a more focussed set of simulations of the PA only (**in review** after the results of the validity tests).

## üìå**Next Steps & Ideas to be Discussed**
- Tweak and review the code so far.
- Review and improve simulations (specifically in `Simulations_PA.ipynb`, as I have now a better understanding of the interpretation).
- Can we *quantitatively* link the observed fractal trends to star formation modes/efficency?
    - YSOs List from Megeath et al.
    - Relation YSOs/fractal dimension and star formation modes üßê.
- Comparison with literature.
