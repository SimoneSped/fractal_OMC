# Characterizing the fractal dimension of the Orion Molecular Cloud
Repository of the code for the Master Thesis "Characterizing the fractal dimension of the Orion Molecular Cloud". 
- Read [Fractal_Dimension_PA.ipynb](https://github.com/SimoneSped/fractal_OMC/blob/main/Fractal_Dimension_PA.ipynb) for the analysis with the PA-Relation to Orion A and B.
- Read [Validity_PA_BC.ipynb](https://github.com/SimoneSped/fractal_OMC/blob/main/Validity_PA_BC.ipynb) for the comparison with other methods (Box Counting) and overall properties of the PA relation.
- Read [Simulation_PA.ipynb](https://github.com/SimoneSped/fractal_OMC/blob/main/Simulations_PA.ipynb) for a more focussed set of simulations of the PA only (in review after the results of the validity tests).
